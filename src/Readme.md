# Jigoku Tsushin (Hell Correspondence) - React Clone

This project is a modern fan recreation of the iconic "Jigoku Tsushin" website from the anime *Jigoku Shoujo (Hell Girl)*. It is built with **React** and **Vite** to demonstrate state management, CSS animations, and input validation logic.

## Features

- **React State Management:** Seamless transitions between the entry, animation, and final screens.
- **Input Validation:** Prevents submission of empty requests.
- **Custom CSS Animations:** Hand-coded fire animations and responsive layout.
- **Immersive UI:** Faithful recreation of the anime's atmosphere with a modern touch.

## Hidden Features (Easter Eggs)

The system has built-in logic to recognize the "Residents of Hell".
Try typing the following names into the input box to see what happens:
- **Enma Ai**
- **Wanyudo**
- **Ichimoku Ren**
- **Hone Onna**
- **Kikuri**

> *"Residents of Hell cannot be judged."*

##  Technologies Used

- React.js
- Vite
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Keyframe Animations)
